Cool Smithy Games - 2022</a></h2>

A tower defense game where instead of multiple towers, there is one programmable weapon that you upgrade by adding new parts. As Lead Game Programmer, I created all the core systems in the game, the highlight being the programmable weapon with modular components that are either projectiles or modifiers, which create a near infinite amount of unique weapons. I worked on this project from start to finish, starting from the design process to post launch updates.
