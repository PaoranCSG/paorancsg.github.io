Welcome to my portfolio, here is a showcase of my projects, with loads of more to come. I have 3 years of professional experience with game development and many more years of hobbyist development and studies on the subject. My main skills are in Unity and C# game development, but I have loads of additional skills in PHP, SQL, C++, C, Scrum, Unreal Engine, java, html, css, world building, game design and 25 years of gaming experience.

<h2> Cool Smithy Games 2021-</h2>
<h3 id="new-game"> Senior Game Programmer - D.P.S: Weapons Testing Facility 2 - Cool Smithy Games - 2025</h3>
The sequel to Dr. Professor Scientist's Weapons Testing Facility, rebuilt from the ground up and including multiple new systems to make the game more fun. Like the original it includes the programmable weapon, with two added side-weapons. Added mutations which allow the player to mutate
their components to suit their playstyle. Wave selection system that changes how every wave works and gives rewards to the player. All programming and a large part of the game design was done by me.

<h3 id="clockwork-survivors"> Senior Game Programmer - Clockwork Survivors - Cool Smithy Games - 2023</h3>
An autoshooter and autorunner game where you only need to jump and avoid enemies and collect powerups and experience.

I created a seeded map generator and an upgrade system, where you gain a combination of two upgrades. I also created some shaders, including a shield shader and a fluid shader. I created a UI system which works on both a controller and with a pointer.

The game is published in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062390/Clockwork_Survivors">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/clockwork-survivors-c6b7c4"> Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href= "https://coolsmithygames.itch.io/clockwork-survivors">itch.io</a>.

<h3 id="dps"> Senior Game Programmer - Dr Professor Scientist's Weapons Testing Facility - Cool Smithy Games - 2022</h3>

A tower defense game where instead of multiple towers, there is one programmable weapon that you upgrade by adding new parts. 

As Senior Game Programmer, I created all the core systems in the game, the highlight being the programmable weapon with modular components that are either projectiles or modifiers, which create a near infinite amount of unique weapons. I also made all of the shaders, and added steam and epic games integration and achievements. I made the UI including the different inventories, upgrade slots, radar, I worked on this project from start to finish, starting from the design process to post launch updates. 

The game is published in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894320/Dr_Professor_Scientists_Weapons_Testing_Facility/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dr-professor-scientists-weapons-testing-facility-20a02f">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://coolsmithygames.itch.io/dpswtf"> itch.io</a>.

<h3 id="llh"> Senior Game Programmer - Last Lap Heroes - Cool Smithy Games - 2021</h3>

A multiplayer asynchronous turn based racing game. I created a track building tool where you build a track using splines and then a grid is automatically generated for it. I made the whole turnbased asynchronous gameplay loop.
I also made an online matchmaking system using the SteamP2P technology.
