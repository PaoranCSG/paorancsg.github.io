<h2 id="clockwork-survivors"> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062390/Clockwork_Survivors">Lead Game Programmer - Clockwork Survivors Cool Smithy Games - 2023</a></h2>
An autoshooter game where you only need to jump and avoid enemies and collect powerups and experience.

I created a seeded map generator for clockwork survivors, and an upgrade system where you gain two different upgrades each time a primary and a secondary improvement.

A tower defense game where instead of multiple towers, there is one programmable weapon that you upgrade by adding new parts. 

As Lead Game Programmer, I created all the core systems in the game, the highlight being the programmable weapon with modular components that are either projectiles or modifiers, which create a near infinite amount of unique weapons. I worked on this project from start to finish, starting from the design process to post launch updates.

<h2 id="llh"> Lead Game Programmer - Last Lap Heroes - Cool Smithy Games - 2021</h2>

A multiplayer asynchronous turn based racing game. I created a track building tool where you build a track using splines and then a grid is automatically generated for it. 
I also made an online matchmaking system using the SteamP2P technology.
